```

Communication flows both upward and downward through this hierarchy, with specialized support agents providing cross-cutting expertise as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Roo Code
- Basic understanding of software development principles
- Project requirements or specifications to start with

### Initial Setup

1. **Drop the .roo folder into your workspace**

2. **Copy the contents of `custom_modes.json` to your global or project mode configuration**  

3. **Start with the Composer**:
   Begin by describing your project to the `Composer`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Project Initialization with Symphony Composer

**Prompt to `Composer`**:
```
I need a web application that allows users to track their daily exercises, view progress over time, and receive personalized workout recommendations. Please create an initial project specification and architecture design.
```

**Expected Response**:
```
I'll help you create the initial project specification and architecture for your exercise tracking web application. Let me start by gathering the key requirements and defining the high-level architecture.

First, I'll create the project specification:

[Creates symphony-exercise-tracker/specs/project-specification.md with detailed content]

Next, I'll create the initial architecture diagrams:

[Creates symphony-exercise-tracker/specs/architecture-diagrams.md with C4 model diagrams in Mermaid]

I've established the core architectural decisions:
- Progressive web app with responsive design for cross-device usage
- React frontend with Material UI components
- Node.js/Express backend with RESTful API
- MongoDB for storing user profiles and workout data
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Recommendation engine using simple ML-based approach

I've also initialized the core Symphony file structure and set the initial automation level to "medium".

Now, I'll delegate the strategic planning to Symphony Score to break down this specification into actionable goals and create the initial project map visualization.
```

### Example 2: Task Delegation with Symphony Conductor and Symphony Performer

**Delegation from `Conductor` to `Performer`**:
```
You've been assigned Task-ID GOAL-02-TASK-03 to implement the user authentication service with JWT token generation and validation. Please analyze the task and implement the solution.
```

**Expected Response**:
```
I'll implement the user authentication service with JWT token generation and validation as assigned in GOAL-02-TASK-03. Let me start by analyzing the task requirements.

First, I'll check the task details:

[Reads symphony-exercise-tracker/tasks/goal-02/goal-02-sheet.md]

Now, I'll initialize my work log:

[Creates symphony-exercise-tracker/logs/goal-02-task-03/goal-02-task-03-work-log.md]

Let me also check the related specifications and security requirements:

[Reads relevant specification and security requirement files]

Based on my analysis, I'll implement a Node.js authentication service with the following components:
1. User registration endpoint
2. User login endpoint with JWT token generation
3. Token validation middleware
4. Password hashing with bcrypt
5. Token refresh mechanism

Here's my implementation plan:
[Details sequential implementation steps]

[Implements the solution with appropriate code files outside symphony structure]

I've completed self-verification of the implementation:
- Tested user registration with validation
- Tested login and token generation
- Verified token validation middleware
- Confirmed secure password storage with bcrypt
- Tested token refresh flow

All deliverables are now complete. I'm notifying the Conductor that Task-ID GOAL-02-TASK-03 is ready for review and testing.
```

## User Command Interface

Symphony's user command interface allows direct interaction with agents through standardized commands. Commands always begin with a forward slash (`/`) followed by the command name and any required parameters.

### User Command Examples

#### Example 1: Checking Task Status with Conductor

**Prompt to Symphony Conductor**:
```
/task-list
```

**Expected Response**:
```
Here's the current task list for GOAL-02 (User Authentication & Profile Management):

| Task ID | Description | Status | Assigned to | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| GOAL-02-TASK-01 | Design user data model | Complete | symphony-performer | None |
| GOAL-02-TASK-02 | Implement user registration API | Testing | symphony-checker | GOAL-02-TASK-01 |
| GOAL-02-TASK-03 | Implement JWT authentication | Complete | symphony-performer | GOAL-02-TASK-01 |
| GOAL-02-TASK-04 | Create profile management API | Assigned | symphony-performer | GOAL-02-TASK-01 |
| GOAL-02-TASK-05 | Implement frontend login component | Not Started | N/A | GOAL-02-TASK-03 |
| GOAL-02-TASK-06 | Implement frontend profile component | Not Started | N/A | GOAL-02-TASK-04 |
| GOAL-02-TASK-07 | Integration testing | Not Started | N/A | GOAL-02-TASK-02, GOAL-02-TASK-03, GOAL-02-TASK-04 |

Is there a specific task you'd like more details on? You can use /task-details [task-id] to see full information.
```

#### Example 2: Requesting Security Review

**Prompt to Symphony Security Specialist**:
```
/code-review src/auth/authService.js
```

**Expected Response**:
```
I'll perform a security code review on src/auth/authService.js.

[Reads the file and performs analysis]

Security Review Results for src/auth/authService.js:

✅ Strong Points:
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- JWT tokens configured with expiration
- Input validation before authentication attempts
- No hardcoded secrets (using environment variables)

⚠️ Security Issues:
1. [MEDIUM] Line 45: JWT token expiration time (24h) is excessive. Recommend reducing to 1-2 hours with refresh token pattern.
2. [HIGH] Line 62: Missing rate limiting on login attempts, creating vulnerability to brute force attacks.
3. [LOW] Line 78: Verbose error messages may reveal too much information about system structure.

🛡️ Recommendations:
1. Implement rate limiting on login endpoint (max 5-10 attempts per IP)
2. Reduce JWT expiration time and implement refresh token pattern
3. Make error messages generic ("Authentication failed") without details
4. Add CSRF protection for authentication endpoints
5. Consider adding two-factor authentication support

I've documented these findings in symphony-exercise-tracker/security/reviews/code-reviews-goal-02-task-03.md for reference.
```

#### Example 3: Generating Project Map with Score

**Prompt to Symphony Score**:
```
/project-map
```

**Expected Response**:
```
Here's the current project map for the Exercise Tracker application:

```mermaid
graph TD
    GOAL-01[GOAL-01: System Architecture Setup] --> GOAL-02[GOAL-02: User Authentication & Profile Management]
